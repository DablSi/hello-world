# hello-world
So... My name is Sonya. Im 13 yers old. I like watching letsplays on pixel games or funny free games. I like cheese. I have lots of games in my Steam account which Id like to play. Buuut I dont have my own computer. And playing on my mothers laptop is pretty difficult. She always need it.
I dream to play great games and to be a part of their creation.
Oh, also try banana and chocolate icecream together. Its perfect.
